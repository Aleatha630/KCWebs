      <br>
      <p class="text-white text-justify">
        The immense hype surrounding the cloud has led many companies to ask the question “What can the cloud do for us?” While some IT directors may have a good idea of how cloud 		services 	work, there is often a lack of understanding how those services are best implemented. That’s where I come in. My cloud consulting service concentrates on evaluating business plans and the existing IT infrastructure to determine how your company can maximize the benefits of the cloud.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="text-white text-justify">
        I have been providing cloud consulting services for small to medium size organizations – government included – for over two years. During this time, I encountered many establishments that were utilizing the services provided by one of the major cloud service providers (i.e. Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Google). However, in each case I was able to identify flaws in the current cloud service implementation and/or assist with maximizing the benefits of using cloud services. If your business is planning to use cloud services or has already implemented cloud services, I can help to ensure that you get the most out of the cloud.

     <h3 class="text-center text-dark">How I can Help You</h3>
     <br>
     <p class="sitebodytext text-dark text-justify">
       Often, many small businesses find they can benefit from cloud IT solutions. However, without the assistance of knowledgeable cloud architects, many small business owners are not able to make the connection between the IT services their business requires and the cloud computing services offered today. As a matter fact, many small business owners who lack intermediate IT knowledge are usually confused about cloud computing all together. That’s where I come in – My job is to evaluate your current IT business infrastructure and/or plans and use my knowledge regarding public cloud services to most efficiently implement cloud services in your IT business infrastructure. If your business has a website, if you keep inventory electronically, use ERP and/or CRM software to manage business transactions and client data, and so on, there is a good chance you can use my services. 
     </p>
     <p class="sitebodytext text-dark text-justify">
       I have thirteen years of experience in software development. In many cases, I have been able to develop applications that are hosted and maintained for a fraction of the cost of the company’s current IT solution. Most small business owners can benefit from centralized solutions. For example, a salon owner who I worked with a few months ago used several different IT solutions from different vendors to fulfil the IT needs of her business. Her salon website/storefront was hosted on Wix, her domain name was registered with GoDaddy, she used a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to manage inventory, and a web application for client appointments hosted by a third-party vendor. This dispersion of IT related business resources can be very confusion for small business owners who aren’t IT savvy – My client confided in me that she once forgot her annual domain name registration, which caused her website to become unavailable to customers. To help my client avoid similar embarrassment in the future. I used Amazon’s public cloud services to streamline the customers IT needs. Instead of using Wix for webhosting, the client’s website now utilizes serverless solutions built with Amazon’s Lambda and S3 for webhosting. I moved her domain name from GoDaddy to Amazon’s Route53 and used AWS Certificate Manager to manage security for the client’s website. Since her website no longer resides on a server, the client is not obligated to pay fees for webhosting. My client is saving hundreds on monthly IT cost, because in addition to webhosting, all her other IT needs have also been resolved by IT solutions built on top public cloud services and managed in one central location. Many public cloud services offer free tier accounts and only charge for resources that are used. This helps small businesses by allowing them to purchase only what they need when they need it.
